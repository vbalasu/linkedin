# linkedin

Python and NodeJS scripts to visit LinkedIn, login and take a screenshot

Run them as follows:

`python linkedin.py` - Uses Selenium and Chromedriver

`node linkedin.js` - Uses Puppeteer

Both scripts save a screenshot to a file named `linkedin.jpg`

If you want to run `linkedin.js` in the NodeJS REPL, strip out the surrounding async function and use `.load` to read the script.
